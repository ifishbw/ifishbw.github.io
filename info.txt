Portal™ is a new single player game from Valve. Set in the mysterious
 Aperture Science Laboratories, Portal has been called one of the most innovative new games on the horizon and will 
offer gamers hours of unique gameplay.

The game is designed to change the way players approach, manipulate, and surmise the possibilities in a 
given environment; similar to how Half-Life® 2's Gravity Gun innovated new ways to leverage an object in any given situation.

Players must solve physical puzzles and challenges by opening portals to 
maneuvering objects, and themselves, through space.

The Stanley Parable is a first person exploration game. You will play as Stanley, 
and you will not play as Stanley. You will follow a story, you will not follow a story. You will have a choice, 
you will have no choice. The game will end, the game will never end.
Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. This world was not made
 for you to understand.

But as you explore, slowly, meaning begins to arise, the paradoxes might start to make sense, perhaps you are powerful after 
all. The game is not here to fight you; it is inviting you to dance.

Based on the award-winning 2011 Source mod of the same name, The Stanley Parable returns with new content, new ideas, a
 fresh coat of visual paint, and the stunning voicework of Kevan Brighting. For a more complete and
 in-depth understanding of what The Stanley Parable is, please try out the free demo.
