The Henry Stickmin Collection is a Newgrounds choose-your-own-path classic, reborn and revitalized. This 6-game epic culminates in multiple entirely canon, extremely different endings. Each step of the journey has you choose from options such as a Teleporter or calling in your buddy Charles to help you out. Correct choices will move the story forward, but incorrect choices lead to a fail. If you get to the end on your first try, you’re doing it wrong. Failing is half the fun.

An Old Series, Remastered

The Henry Stickmin games have seen some good times on the internet, but age has not been kind. Breaking the Bank has been completely reanimated from scratch. Escaping the Prison, Stealing the Diamond, Infiltrating the Airship and Fleeing the Complex have all had their backgrounds and sound effects redone!
