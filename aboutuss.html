<p>The Bones Whisper Game is A Passion Project of Me Benjamin Westlake It has been a Game I have been working on as a hobby for 
2 years now. But enough about the game I am a student at University of Utah studying Game Design and computer Science. I Love Speedrunning in Games I have gotten a sub 1:30 in Mario Odyessy 
and have found speedrun glitches in GhostRunner. My love for speedrunning and movement very much shows in Bones Whisper with multipath rooms and leaving in speedrun tricks while also having
 many advanced movement tricks. The Game also shows my great love for The Messenger by Sabotage Studio Merci Thierry Boulanger (its a Messenger Reference).
Most of my game creation experience is self taught in Game Maker Studio 2. I did end up making a game before this which was a really short wild west platformer based around wall jumping. 
The wild west game was not very good but did give me good experience in game maker.
I did get to show off this Wild west game at a showcase at my highschool in 10th grade and being able to see people interact with your game and get involed and have fun is an amazing experience and is
 What I strive for. The other Crazy Amazing experience is getting Bones Whisper on the front page of opera GX for a week receiving 19000 + plays on the games demo. On GXC I don't even have the speedrun record for my own game.

<!--<p>We are a company that secertly runs all good game studio's from teh inside with out you knowing until 
now of course. but all those bad games you have played we didn't make just the ones you like. I don't want 
to get into tthe nitty gritty deatails of how that works and how we run only good ones but hey im not going to
 give away company secerts.</p> <p> Even if the the studio doesn't say they are run by us it's a lie they are 
still run by us they just may not know it. we have some of the best in the video game industry working for us. 
We try to excel in making you beleive we run the companies who make the games you love not any of the other games 
just the ones your love.
 In retrospect making it secret was a bad idea well I guess this is what this website is trying to solve.</p>-->

<!--<h2 id="history">My History</h2>

<p>It
 started when I was in 6th grade I created an idea to create a comic book and call it sketchy comics. it
 then turned into a series of comic strips and put it on a website they were bad but it was fun and I still 
own the sketchy comics domain name.</p><p>I later got more into gaming throughout highschool and created design 
documents for many games such as wild west train heist game and that one top down shooter. I really hit a home 
run with my idea bones whisper which becam e its own small 
world for me to explore and it became a fun yet short demo I work on it periodically.</p>
<p>then we get to the part fo the history where I write the history for the website s oit gets kinda crazy. 
My demo of Bones Whisper was so good that everyone loved and i was able to recruit my epic team of gaming disciples
 the legendary few that had such talent and even bigger ego's
 we became 30% of the gaming industry after vince got gabe newell to get on board.</p>
<p>But as a super humble man I decided to make most of the work my self. But we are also a 
secret organization that secretly runs almost all game studios you name it we run it devolver, 
valve, rare, epic ( we lost control of them went fortnite came out so don't blame us),
 sony, team cheerry, nintendo, and the list goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>Now our history doesn't make sense and it's super unrealistic but 
since this will probalby never be read I doubt it makes a difference.</p>-->
