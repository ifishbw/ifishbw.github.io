	<h1>what are we about</h1>
	<hr noshade="noshade">
<p>We are a company that secertly runs all good game studio's from teh inside with out you knowing until 
now of course. but all those bad games you have played we didn't make just the ones you like. I don't want 
to get into tthe nitty gritty deatails of how that works and how we run only good ones but hey im not going to
 give away company secerts.</p> <p> Even if the the studio doesn't say they are run by us it's a lie they are 
still run by us they just may not know it. we have some of the best in the video game industry working for us. 
We try to excel in making you beleive we run the companies who make the games you love not any of the other games 
just the ones your love.
 In retrospect making it secret was a bad idea well I guess this is what this website is trying to solve.</p>
<p>the normal paragraph text words text even more words I just need to make a subsantual 
	body of text  to see how it looks but I feel it is long enough or is it ill just keep writing for another line
so hi from the next line its cool down here like the back of a bus I now i kept the place holder text in if you actually noticed congrats.</p>
